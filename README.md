The applications are only for tests and not implement security, design, usability and others features.


## Service 1

- Service 1:

Visual Recognition
"Visual Recognition allows users to understand the contents of an image or video frame, answering the question: “What is in this image?” Submit an image, and the service returns scores for relevant classifiers representing things such as objects, events and settings. What types of images are relevant to your business? How could you benefit from understanding and organizing those images based on their contents? With Visual Recognition, users can automatically identify subjects and objects contained within the image and organize and classify these images into logical categories. Need to train Visual Recognition on specific or custom content? Easily train a new classifier by sending examples and voila! Custom image recognition!" by 'http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html'

## Service 2

- Service 2: 

- Language Translation (english to spanish)
"The Watson Language Translation service provides domain-specific translation utilizing Statistical Machine Translation techniques that have been perfected in our research labs over the past few decades. Currently, three domains are available that provide translation among a total of seven languages. For best results, a domain that matches the content to be translated should be chosen." by 'http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html'

- Cloudant NoSQL DB
"Cloudant is a NoSQL database as a service (DBaaS) built from the ground up to scale globally, run non-stop, and handle a wide variety of data types like JSON, full-text, and geo spatial. Cloudant is an operational data store optimized to handle concurrent reads & writes, and provide high availability and data durability.
Access 'http://v-app.mybluemix.net/apps', write a text and click 'Go' to translate." by 'https://cloudant.com/getting-started-with-cloudant-ibm-bluemix/'
